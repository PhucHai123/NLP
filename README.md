This project was done by my team using Python (Google Colaboratory).

The data was scraped from Twitter. 

Day set: 7/1/2022.

Topics scraped: 'Sony', 'politics', 'environment', 'technology', 'travel', 'sustainability', 
'economy', 'social media', 'sport', 'music', 'photography', 'healthcare', 'education', 'Sony and politics', 'Sony and environment', 'Sony and technology',
'Sony and travel', 'Sony and sustainability', 'Sony and economy', 'Sony and social media', 'Sony and sport', 'Sony and music', 'Sony and photography'

The "Data.zip" file included all files we used in the project.

This project was made to see the pros and cons of the 2 classification method (Bayesian Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier) and other educational purposes so we've censored the API key we received from the Twitter's developers (we asked for their permission and the key). No information about the API key will be provided.
